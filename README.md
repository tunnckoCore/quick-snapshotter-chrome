# Quick Snapshotter

A Google Chrome extension that allows you to effortlessly select and capture screenshots of specific HTML elements or free-form regions on any webpage.

## Features
- **Precise Element Selection**: Hover over elements to see exactly what will be captured. Elements larger than the screen are smartly bounded to your visible viewport so captures never end up blank.
- **Drag Selection**: Click and drag to capture a free-form region anywhere on the screen.
- **Resizable Area**: Once a selection is locked, use the corner and edge handles to fine-tune your capture area.
- **Action Menu**: Click to lock onto an element or finish dragging to reveal quick actions.
- **Download**: Instantly download the cropped screenshot.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Copy the image directly to your clipboard for easy pasting anywhere.
- **Customizable**: Set global shortcuts and configure your default download behavior via the extension's popup menu.

## Installation
Currently, the extension is installed via Developer Mode in Chrome.

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open Chrome/Brave/Helium and navigate to `chrome://extensions/` (yes it does work on any Chromium-based browser).
3. Enable **Developer mode** in the top right corner.
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the folder containing this extension's code.

## Usage
1. Trigger the extension by using the global shortcut (`Ctrl+Shift+F` by default), clicking the toolbar icon, or using the right-click context menu.
2. Hover over the element you wish to capture, or click and drag to draw a custom region.
3. Lock the selection (by clicking the element or releasing the drag).
4. Choose **Download** or **Copy to Clipboard** from the floating menu. (Press **Cancel** or hit the `Escape` key to abort).

> **Note on Downloads:** For security reasons, Chrome Extensions can only silently download files into the default `Downloads` directory (or a subfolder of it). If you want to browse and choose a different folder for every screenshot, open the extension's popup menu and check "Always ask where to save (Browse...)".
